### Our lab is combining technology, pertubations, and computation to study health and disease in response to therapeutics.

## Current topics of our research include:

- Understanding continuous cell state transitions in cardiovascular disease
- Dissecting the principles of tissue organization through ovarian remodeling
- Examining the heterogeneity in cellular response to targeted protein degradation therapeutics for hormone-dependent cancers
- Novel single-cell and spatial proteogenomics tools
